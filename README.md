## Description 
General overview of the project, what you did, why you did it, etc.\

My project, an Inventory Item Manager, is a comprehensive system designed to facilitate the management of stock keeping units (SKUs) in an inventory setting. My motivation behind this project stems from my undergraduate degree at Penn State, Supply Chain & Information Systems  and my experience as a Procurement & Logistics Analyst at Reliance Steel. I have a lot of knowledge in the logistics of tracking inventory items, and such that I was comfortable with that knowledge to build a simple yet effective tool in python to organize and track inventory items, particularly in small business environments. This specific application caters to basic inventory management needs, allowing users to add, remove, list, and summarize inventory items efficiently and effectively.

## Key Features
Highlight some key features of this project that you want to show off/talk about/focus on. \

I believe this application provides a very clear and user-friendly interface for adding, removing, list, and summarizing SKUs. This simplicity ensures that users with minimal technical expertise, especially those with small businesses, can effectively and efficiently interact with this system. One pretty neat feature is the ability to summarize SKUs by category. This functions offers the user valuable insights into their inventory stock by category, allowing for quick assessment and decision making based on category stock levels and what the user might need to purchase/when in the near future. In addition to summarizing, the user is also able to list each individual SKU ever saved.

## Guide
How do we run your project? What should we do to see it in action? - Note this isn't installing, this is actual use of the project.. If it is a website, you can point towards the gui, use screenshots, etc talking about features. 


## Installation Instructions
If we wanted to run this project locally, what would we need to do?  If we need to get API key's include that information, and also command line startup commands to execute the project. If you have a lot of dependencies, you can also include a requirements.txt file, but make sure to include that we need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or something similar.

## Code Review
Go over key aspects of code in this section. Both link to the file, include snippets in this report (make sure to use the [coding blocks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code)).  Grading wise, we are looking for that you understand your code and what you did. 

### Major Challenges
Key aspects could include pieces that your struggled on and/or pieces that you are proud of and want to show off.


## Example Runs
Explain how you documented running the project, and what we need to look for in your repository (text output from the project, small videos, links to videos on youtube of you running it, etc)

## Testing
How did you test your code? What did you do to make sure your code was correct? If you wrote unit tests, you can link to them here. If you did run tests, make sure you document them as text files, and include them in your submission. 

> _Make it easy for us to know you *ran the project* and *tested the project* before you submitted this report!_


## Missing Features / What's Next
Focus on what you didn't get to do, and what you would do if you had more time, or things you would implement in the future. 

## Final Reflection
Write at least a paragraph about your experience in this course. What did you learn? What do you need to do to learn more? Key takeaways? etc.
